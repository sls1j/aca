Incident Result: No Consequence

Present at accident: yes
 Involved in rescue: yes
     Role in rescue: I was one of the people trapped, and we self-rescued

Description of accident/incident: 
In late 2012, while exploring and digging in one of our new discoveries, we 
had an entrapment incident that has not, I believe, been previously 
reported. I, Tom, and Dave were digging in one part of the cave in an upper 
level while other members of the group were working on a different level 
elsewhere in the cave. The three of us opened up a new passage which we 
explored to an apparently bedrock wall with a room visible beyond. After 
moving a large rock out of the way at the base of the wall, Tom went 
through a narrow Z-shaped crawl, approximately 2ft wide by 1ft high, that 
stepped up and to the left. He reported that he could see more passage 
above and it was safe to come through. I followed him through the narrow 
crawl, but a few moments later I heard a grinding sound from behind me and 
a cloud of dust, and then Dave shouting that there had been a collapse. 

It turned out that the wall we had crawled under was not a wall, but 
instead a large fractured slab; it had declared itself as such by settling 
several inches into our exit. Tom and I asked Dave if we could still get 
out, and he said he didn’t know. We were about to send him for help when 
two other members of the group arrived to see what was happening. Worried 
about further collapse of the wall, I re-entered the crawl to see whether 
it was passable; it had been reduced in size to a pinch, but still appeared 
navigable. I could see the underside of the slab that had settled, and it 
seemed to be hanging above a large rock on the floor, so I wedged several 
more pieces of rock under it to prevent further collapse. Once it looked 
temporarily stable, Tom and I were able to exit the way we had entered, 
although we had to go feet-first to negotiate the reduced crawl with the 
guidance of the others. 

Tom and I got lucky in this instance, both that the collapse did not occur 
with one of us in the crawl, and in that we were able to prop up the slab 
and exit without a rescue. I can’t tell you how many times I have heard 
cavers say “it’s fine, just don’t touch it.” I have never personally 
believed that to be a wise approach to caving, but the lure of virgin 
passage sometimes overwhelms better judgment. This incident is a clear 
example of why one should not enter questionable passages without testing 
their stability beforehand.

  Incident Type: Trapped/Stranded
Incident Result: No Consequence

Present at accident: yes
 Involved in rescue: yes
     Role in rescue: I was one of the trapped cavers, and we self-rescued

Description of accident/incident: 
In 2014, while exploring another new discovery in Vermont, I, John Keough, 
Morgan Ingalls, and Ramon Armen were trapped by a rockfall in a new 
passage. We had been working to enlarge a narrow stream crawl to access 
passage beyond with an original group of eight, and four members of the 
group headed out of the cave in later afternoon. We told them to expect to 
see us by 4:00pm, and the four of us stayed to work the dig a bit longer. 
Around 3:00, shortly after they left, Ramon crawled through and reported a 
large dome and continuing passage beyond. John K, Morgan, and I all 
followed him through for a quick look around; wisely, we brought along a 
hammer, crowbar, and cave pack. The crawl was extremely small, requiring us 
to squeeze between the ceiling and floor in the stream, but all four of us 
made it into the cave.

Ramon and Morgan went to investigate the downstream direction, and John K 
and I stayed to take some pictures in the dome and look around. After a few 
minutes I started to get cold, so I started hammering off some of the 
ceiling protrusions that had made the stream crawl a difficult entrance. 
Without warning, a boulder the size of an engine block fell out of the 
right-hand wall beside the crawlway and dropped neatly in front of the 
exit. It had apparently been entirely detached due to a mud seam behind it, 
and held in place by little more than friction. When it fell, it wedged 
itself against the far wall of the passage.

Fortunately, we were all experienced cavers and diggers with rescue 
training, we had given the rest of the group an exit time, and we had 
options in the meantime. The boulder had wedged between its previous 
location and the opposite wall, and it was sitting on a solid floor. We set 
about taking turns hammering on the edges of the boulder, and after some 
time managed to break off enough pieces for it to theoretically move out of 
the way. Using the crowbar I was then able to walk the boulder away from 
the exit a few centimeters at a time. 

We managed to gain enough space for Morgan, the smallest member of the 
group by several inches, to squeeze over the boulder and get through the 
crawl. We told her to go and retrieve a pack with a hammer drill and point 
that was already in the cave a few hundred feet away, then to go tell the 
surface team to call out a rescue. While she was gone, though, we succeeded 
in walking the boulder back far enough for the remaining three of us to 
exit, and we met Morgan on her way back with the hammer drill. When we 
reached the surface it was five minutes to 4:00; as it turned out, we had 
been trapped for only about ½ an hour.

Although one can never predict what will happen in a virgin cave, one can 
take precautions. We had tools, food, water, an exit time, and surface 
support in the form of other members of the group. We kept our heads and 
worked quickly to self-rescue from what could have been a much worse 
situation. We also got lucky; the boulder looked like part of the wall, and 
it could easily have fallen on a caver coming out of the crawl had one of 
us grabbed it for support or pushed against it. In general, the outcome was 
a self-rescue and a safer cave.

I also made one major mistake. As diggers we get used to modifying 
passages, but Bob Dion admonished me afterwards, the rule of thumb should 
be “Don’t modify the exit from the inside.”

Hi ACA, re: cave rescue June 20-21, 2015 Near Collingwood, Ontario, Canada

I have learned via the media only, of a successfully crevasse cave rescue 
on ~June20-21,2015 of a “hiker” that got themselves stuck. Near 
Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. (I have sent the rescue people a 
congratulations for a job well done, and have let them know about NCRC at 
Mammoth cave area this year. Just in case they might be interested.)

Incident Result: Injury, No Aid

Present at accident: yes

     Role in rescue: Patient, self rescuer

Description of accident/incident: 
Names and ages of persons involved: Derek Bristol (46), two other companions

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): NA

Describe the events leading up to the accident: Our group of 3 hiked roughly 3 miles to the 
cave with the intent of exploring and pushing leads.

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: Shortly after entering the cave, Bristol was 
chimneying up a 10 foot high vertical slot through a roughly 9 inch squeeze that had a small 
opening above. The opening looked like a blind pocket, but the climb was being done to be 
thorough. There was only a small pocket available for the left foot so Bristol was pushing hard 
off the front of the foot to overcome the friction from the tight spot. A sudden pop was felt 
followed by pain in the lower calf. Bristol was able to climb back down and return to his 
teammates. After removing the left boot it was apparent that he had suffered a full rupture of 
the achilles tendon.

Nature of injuries sustained: Full rupture of the left achilles tendon

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: Significant force was being applied to the left foot, 
but there was no sudden trauma such as from a fall. There may have been some existing 
tendinitis, which combined with age, resulted in some weakening of the tendon.

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.): None

What might have been done to prevent the accident? It seems it was just time. There is really 
nothing unusual about what was being done when the injury occurred, and nothing that could 
have been done to prevent it.

Actions following the accident or incident: One of the team members had a trekking pole that 
Bristol borrowed for the hike back to their vehicle. Weight could be put on the left heel, but not 
the toe. Bristol was able to get out of the cave and hike the 3 miles, including two stream 
crossings, without assistance. The tendon has been surgically repaired and a full recovery is 
expected.

List any persons or organizations contacted for help: None

Describe any rescue procedures which occurred: Small party self-rescue

List any sources or reports with further details 
   (newspapers, grotto newsletters, etc.): None

Additional comments or analysis: None

I have been an outdoors person all 31 years that I've been alive, and I know how to clean up after myself and not leave it for someone else to do. I am from Gwinnett county GA, and it's about a 2.5 to 3 hour drive to get to Pigeon mountain. So to drive that far and have to deal with gropus of people that have no respect for the outdoors is painfully disturbing.

Are there anymore caves nearby that are about the same level of difficulty as Pettijohn? I have heard of Hurricane Cave do you know where I can find a map of Hurricane cave?

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: 

Rob climbed (without ropes, helmet, or gear) along the left ledge (approx.
60ft up) inside Stephen's Gap Cave after an hour of walking around the cave
and exploring. He did not notice the wet mud he tracked along the ledge.
After spending a few minutes looking over the edge, he tried several times

down and yelled to his friend - who then alerted a team of repellers who
were setting up their gear at the top of the cave. The repellers happened
to be members of the Huntsville Cave Rescue Unit (Kevin Reeves, Brad
Phillips, Michelle Edwards, etc). Michelle Edwards repelled down to Rob
with a harness and then lowered him to the bottom of the cave. They then
ascended up and exited the cave. It took about an hour for Michelle to
perform the rescue.

Description of accident/incident: 
On September 6, 2015, our team of cavers and friends had planned to rappel
down Stephens Gap around 1:30 pm after spending the morning doing test
rappels at Desoto Falls Park. When we arrived, we noticed a helicopter in a
nearby field, a few cars and an ambulance near the trail to Stephen's Gap.
After speaking to an officer and being informed that a young boy had
fallen, we volunteered to help in the rescue and offered for them to use
our equipment if needed. Kevin Reeves from Monrovia Fire-Rescue was part of
our team and we told him he was definitely needed. We (Brad Brown, Kevin
Reeves, Holliday Williams, Rob Eldroc, and Jenny Herman)hiked up to
Stephen's Gap cave with all of our climbing/rappelling equipment. Half way
up, we were informed by the coroner's assistant that Patrick had passed
away and that it would be a body recovery. Kevin Reeves, Aaron Polsky, and
four other rescuers helped secure and pull the body mostly out of the cave
(it took about an hour). Kevin tied and attached all the ropes to help with
the weight of the body. As we began to head down the hill, another one of
our friends, Jackson Graydon arrived and helped assist carrying the body
the rest of the way down (the terrain was difficult and it was a hot day,
so we took turns). Towards the bottom, we transferred the body to a vehicle
and then hiked the rest of the way down.

Present at accident: yes

Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
This trip was my first time into Neffs Cave.  The cave was pre-rigged 
by members of the Salt Lake Grotto and we were a team of four enjoying 
not having to carry in rope and rig the multiple pitches of the 1163ft 
deep cave.  Everything went smooth to the bottom, but as we were headed 
out a near miss occurred.  Climbing out of Lyon's Landing out of the 
Great Pit, as I rounded the edge and came in sight of the rigged anchor 
I came to the stark realization.  The carabiner that the anchor and 
rope were rigged to and which I was loading and climbing on over a 
100ft+ drop was side-loaded and the gate was unlocked. I cautiously 
continued to the top and fortunately the biner held.  


Some notes that I learned from this mishap and what led to this issue:

Always check the rigging and make sure everything is in place before 
any of your team goes on rope.  The main issue that led to this event 
is that our first climber did not recheck and take the slack out of the 
anchor after he got off rope.  So when I hopped on, the slack allowed 
the biner to be side-loaded.  Also, he took off to the next pitch 
without assuring everything was okay when I loaded the system. If he 
would have just waited ten extra seconds for me to load the system, he 
could have caught the issue immediately.

Additionally, because the cave was pre-rigged, I think our normal 
checks and normal way of thinking about rigging was altered a bit and 
which led us to be more unconcerned and less cautious. If a cave is 
being rigged for multiple trips, carrying around a few Black Diamond 
Gridlock Screwgate carabiners is not a bad idea to prevent side-loading 
caused by unobservant teammates.  

Overall lesson: Look After Each Other.

Present at accident: yes

     Role in rescue: Assisted injured caver in self-extraction from the cave system.
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
On 21 November 2015 three cavers from the Central Oklahoma Grotto were 
working on a survey of Cherylsbad Cave in NW Oklahoma.  Sue Bozeman, Dale 
Amlee, and Jon Woltz are all NSS members, each with at least ten years of 
caving experience.  Sue Bozeman has been an active caver since the 
1970's.  Additionally, both Jon and Dale had been through formal training 
in basic underground search and rescue techniques several years prior.  

The three cavers had all been in this particular cave before on several 
occasions.  The survey trip on this particular day lasted roughly 5 to 6 
hours.  At the end of the survey trip the trio headed back towards the 
surface.  Partway back Sue Bozeman stopped to rest for several minutes, 
and shortly informed the other two that she was having difficulty 
breathing and was feeling very weak.  Sue took some Excedrin from her cave 
pack, and rested for about 45 minutes.  Dale and Jon considered going for 
help on the surface, but due to the distances involved in getting a rescue 
to the cave location and then into the cave itself, it was decided to just 
work at helping Sue out of the cave and to the surface.  The cave passage 
in this area is fairly level but very rocky, with numerous boulders to 
climb up, around, or under.  Sue was able to navigate the remainder of the 
cave, with assistance from Jon and Dale over the tricky spots.  Once out 
of the cave, they still faced a hike of about 1/4 mile over uneven ground 
back to the vehicle that had been parked near the entrance.  They were in 
an area with no cell phone service.  Sue was then driven directly to the 
closest hospital, where upon medical diagnosis it was determined that she 
had suffered a mild heart attack.

Description of accident/incident: 
The Salt Lake Grotto Neff's caving trip started in two groups.  The
advanced group of 4 and then to be proceeded 2 hours later a group of 5. 
This was to keep both groups small enough to avoid hypothermia while
waiting to use the rope at the different pitches.  The first group
consisted of Rodney Mulder, Adam Jones, Swede Larson, and Pete Hartley. 
They left at about 8am.  The second group consisted of Kristen Adams, Brian
Dickey, Ben Ling, Bryce Ling, and Joe Voska.  This group left at about 10am
and arrived at the cave around noon.  Where we suited up and entered the cave.

Bryce and Brian pushed forward first while Kristan the team leader helped
Joe with his equipment, it being his first caving trip.

While Brian was down climbing down some boulders his right arm went through
an awkward angle and popped out of join dislocating to the front of the
shoulder.   He finished down climbing until he was to a more level and flat
area.  The injury occurred at approximately 1:00pm though none of party had
any way to tell the exact time.

The following is a description of the actions taken to tread the injury and
rescue the caver.
• Confirmed that the should was an anterior right shoulder dislocation.
• Medicated with 800mg of Ibuprofen
• Made 3 unsuccessful attempts of shoulder reduction using the
Traction-counter traction method.   
• Acted to prevent hypothermia.  Placed "Hot hands" within the cave suit. 
Put an extra coat over the shoulders.  Placed a cave bag underneath and a
sweater behind of patient to insulate against the ground.
• The team split to notify others what had happened.  Kristen Adams went
deeper into the cave to notify the advanced group what had happened and to
get their assistance.  Bryce and Ben Ling went to the surface to contact
the surface watches and the rescue resource coordinator Debbie Spoons. 
Also to retrieve some extra clothing left at the mouth of the cave.  Joe
Vasko stayed with Brian to keep him company and make sure he stayed calm
and safe to wait for help.
• Ben and Bryce returned first with directions from above to wait for the
advanced team and get Brian out under his own power as much as possible.
• Kristen Adams soon returned.  She and Joe began improvising a sling. 
They used a strap from a bag and a piece of webbing from Brian's caving
bag, and an old wool sweater as padding under the elbow.  The strap went
over the shoulder to vertically stabilize the arm and the webbing was
cinched around the chest and one arm to stabilize it both side to side and
front to back.
• The advanced cave party had arrived from down lower.  At this point
Rodney Mulder from the Advanced group, who had SPAR(Small Party Rescue
Techniques) training joined us to begin organizing and planning the rescue.
• The Ibuprofen began taken effect enough for Brian to stand and confirm
that he'd be able to begin climbing when everything was ready.
• Kristen was assigned medic to accompany and work alongside Brian through
out the climb.  Swede Larson, and Peter Hartley supported Kristin and
helped from below to push Brian along. An anchor was setup and Adam Jones
was set as the counter balance for Brian.  Ben and Bryce Ling worked as
communication coordinator with the surface.  Joe Vasko operational provided
support as needed.
• Brian began shaking a little.  Probably from the cold and shock.
• At this point everything was ready to go and Brian began climbing and
making his way toward the entrance of the cave.  This included climbing
over boulders, pushing through a few minor tight areas, and a rope climb. 
Through out this climb Brian warmed up and though some movements were
painful was able to navigate through the cave with some help.
• Brian was beginning to experience increased pain and show some signs of
shock and confusion.  800 mg of Ibuprofen was again administered at this
point.  It was now about 5:30pm.
• The final obstacle was the entrance which was a vertical and narrow hole
about 8 feet deep and 24" wide and 36".  Brian was rigged with a rope from
above and stepped on knees and shoulders from below.  Half way up the climb
some clothing snagged that had to be adjusted and then the sling had to be
removed to keep the arm from snagging on the narrowest part.     
• Once out of the cave a short medical check up was performed on the
patient.  Water and food were administered before an uneventful hike back
to the trail head.
• At this point family of the patient took the him to the hospital for
medical treatment.
	
Describe any rescue procedures which occurred:  

Counter balance - An anchor was placed around large boulders in formations
in the cave.  A "Progress Capture" pulley was attached to the anchor.  A
rope was attached to the patient and another caver was attached on the
other side of the rope to take up slack and help take the body weight of
the patient over climbs that weren't possible with only one good arm.

2 to 1 bottom hall.  To help Brian up the rope a pulley was attached to his
hand ascender.  A rope was passed through the ascender and attached to
Brian's harness.  This way instead of Frogging up the ascent a person at
the bottom of the pitch could pull on the rope to lift the patient up.  All
the patient had to do was push the un-weighted hand ascender up.

Additional comments or analysis: 

This could have been a lot worse.  Things that prevent this from becoming a
true tragedy.  Every member of both teams had adequate caving bags
including first aid kits, extra equipment such as webbing, pulleys, knife,
etc. that could be used to improvise needed gear such as a sling.    Each
caver was adequately dressed and equipped with helmets and lights.

Some things I will be adding to my caving bag: Hot hands.  Last a long
time, are safer than candles for heat, and can be placed close to the skin
of the caver even while the caver is moving.  Will add a small bottle of
Ibuprofen.  This made the difference from the patient being at a level 8
pain unable to move to a level 5 or 6 enabling the patient to move under
his own power.

Most importantly a member of the caving group had SPAR training.  I believe
this is what made the rescue procedure possible without having to call out
any SAR teams.  It also made the rescue far more safe than it would have
been otherwise.   Both techniques describe were SPAR methods that Rodney
had learned.  The more this knowledge spread the better.

     Role in rescue: I was the injured party
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
8 Women, experienced cavers, entered Gourdneck and proceeded at a moderate 
pace back to the waterfall.  Anne Grindle was leading the trip, Susan  
Williamson, Ellen Hofler, Daphna El-Roy Lee Boop, Sue Milburn, Nina ?, 
Susan Wilkerson.  At the waterfall, Susan Williamson volunteered to rig a 
climbing rope to access the upper chamber, followed by Anne Grindle.  
Susan was unsure of where the rigging point was and was looking around up 
on what she was told was called the Saknussemen extention.  She never felt 
at risk, or felt fearful, but just fell back down into the climb up area, 
falling onto rock, maybe 25 ish feet?   Susan fell against the rocks 2-3 
times on the way down striking her helmet and left ear.  She landed on her 
feet, and rolled onto her buttocks and back.  Upon landing she found she 
was relatively miraculously unscathed, stood up, and immediately informed 
her group she wished to leave the cave ASAP.  Susan started quickly 
exiting the cave on her own power, was overtaken by Susan Wilkerson who 
would be her guide out, with Sue Milburn behind her.  They reached the 
climb out quickly, harnessed up. Lee Boop caught up to them, climbed out 
first,  Susan climbed out second, and was driven to the Parkridge west ED 
in Jasper by Anne Grindle.  Susan received 7 sutures to a laceration to 
her L ear.  CT scan of her neck showed an avulsion fracture, No other 
injuries except some bruises on her legs.  She rejoined her group at 
Cavers Paradise several hours later, and was able to enjoy the rest of the 
weekend without incident. 
     Contributing factors were lack of awareness of the extent of the 
exposure danger.  No equipment factors, fatigue or other factors 
identified.
     In retrospect, Susan had two nylon lines in her cave pack, and could 
have easily overcome the exposure in that area by 1. rigging a handline  
2. slowing down and analyzing the area that she had never been to before 
starting to climb up an area with a lot of exposure
     Very sturdy boots were helpful in providing a safe landing, Knee pads 
and elbow pads were on.  Neoprene shorty style sleeveless wetsuit could 
also have been a factor preventing further injury, as well as an amazing
Gaurdian angel on duty.

Names and ages of persons involved: Laura Sangaila, Joe Vaskpo

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): n/a

Describe the events leading up to the accident:

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: 

Nature of injuries sustained: 3 lacerations 10 stitches

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: weak hand hold 

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.): 
slippery slope, 

What might have been done to prevent the accident? setup a handline before 
the downclimb. 
When I came back out to the start of the main passage where the calcified 
roots were located I saw a side passage that started to slope down on an 
angle and had some interesting formations on the ceiling.  I continued to 
stoop walk down the passage and I could see that the slopes angle 
increased but did not look too dangerous as I have done many down climbs 
on sketcher traverses
 I started to down climb and a hand hold broke ( which is a first) and I 
threw my pack to the side, turned on my back and increased friction as 
much as I could while using my feet to protect me for obstructions and my 
knees for shock absorbers but my speed increased until I got down to the 
bottom of the passage. My adrenaline was pumping good and I was hoping I 
did break anything. 
The "slide" was around 30ft on a 50 degree angle and decreased as I got 
near the bottom. I looked at my hands and I had a laceration to my hand 
which did not stop bleeding until I got stitches at the hospital 4 hours 
later, I had a leak in my leg which was a small laceration and another 
laceration on my knee. 
I had to climb back out of this sliding passage and I knew that this would 
have been a challenge but I was down at the bottom so I took a few photos 
of the room and started negotiating my way back up the climb.   The climb 
itself was sketchy and at one point I was in a situation where I felt like 
I very well could have slipped back down so I grabbed onto some holds and 
crawled my way back up to the top.  Thank god I made it out of there. 

Actions following the accident or incident: 

When I made my way through the tight squeeze I cleaned my wound with water 
than alcohol and bandaged a quick clot which seemed to help quite a bit. 
Joe was very calm and accommodative to this situation.  
I climbed back out of the cave with some challenges and Laura was very 
calm and accommodative to providing care with dressing more wounds and 
checking bones and neurological which all appeared to be fine. 
They de rigged and we packed up and headed down a couple thousand feet on 
a steep dry wash hoping we wouldn't run into any dry falls to rap. It took 
a bit longer to get down but eventually we got to the trail and got to the 
hospital with some cuts and lacs which ended up being 10 stitches when it 
was all done

symptoms.  Drove patient to medical care.
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
42y/o woman (remaining anonymous)

The patient and two others entered Laurel Caverns on a volunteer photo trip.
Just into the undeveloped section of the cave the woman was walking across
a room called the Ball Room when she slipped.  She fell in a way that she 
landed with a rock hitting the back of her head up under her helmet.  She 
was immediately rendered unconscious.  She came to after about twenty 
seconds, after making sure she did not have a neck injury she was sat 
upright and checked for a concussion.  Patient was nauseated, but not much 
else.  She exited the cave on her own power, with others making sure she was 
ok, and driven to a hospital where it was confirmed she has sustained a 
moderate concussion.

Analysis of the main cause of the accident:  Woman was new to caving and 
inexperienced with the cave itself.  The accident was just that, an 
accident.  It was a simple misstep that any of us could make.


List any persons or organizations contacted for help:  Other Laurel Caverns 
staff, both on duty and off.

  Incident Type: Caver fall
Incident Result: Injury, No Aid

Present at accident: yes
 Involved in rescue: yes
     Role in rescue: I was the injured party, and our party of three organized a self-rescue.
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
Names and ages of persons involved: Bob Zimmerman (63), Dave Hamer (60s),
Kayla Arendt (20s)

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): none

Describe the events leading up to the accident: This was a survey trip to
check a lead.

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: In climbing a boulder one
of my handholds broke off and I fell about 10 feet, landing on my left side.

Nature of injuries sustained: Broke the smaller of the arm bones about five
inches above the wrist.

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: handhold broke off.

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.): none

What might have been done to prevent the accident? Not much could have
prevented this. In returning to the survey point in September 2016, I found
that I could have easily gotten up the boulder at a different point, but
had not chosen that route because that was where the survey station was
located and the instrument people (Dave and Kayla) were in the process of
reading instruments. As sketcher I did not wish to interfere with this
work, which would have also required us to move the station. I instead
found what was a reasonably easy alternative route, only to have what
seemed like a solid handhold break off just as I was pulling myself up onto
the boulder.

Actions following the accident or incident: Using Kayla's foam butt pad and
Dave's duct tape, we wrapped my arm and wrist to protect it as well as
minimize any movement of the wrist.

List any persons or organizations contacted for help: None

Describe any rescue procedures which occurred: None

List any sources or reports with further details 
   (newspapers, grotto newsletters, etc.): None

Additional comments or analysis: 

Because only one of the lower arm bones was broken, the second bone acted
as a splint, aided by the foam pad. I was able to crawl and walk on my own,
and in fact was able to carry my own shoulder pack for most of the trip out.

The cave itself, from where our survey started, is mostly walking with some
minor climbs and three short hands and knees crawls. I had no problem doing
most of the minor climbs without help. In one case, however, we picked a
snug chimney rather than the normal climb up a boulder. With Kayla on top
and Dave helping from below, I was able to chimney up without much problem.

The entrance has a 35 foot vertical drop that can be free climbed but is
always rigged with a rope. People routinely rappel in, bringing their
vertical systems to climb out, either on the rope or using the vertical
system as a safety as the do the free climb. I used my vertical system to
climb the rope, with Kayla at the entrance to provide assistance if needed
and Dave at the bottom to provide tension on the rope.

To give an idea how smoothly the self rescue was, it took about 2 hours to
reach our survey point from the entrance. The accident happened as we were
setting up our first shot. The exit took about 2 and 1/2 hours, only
slightly longer than our trip in.

  Incident Type: Difficulty on rope
Incident Result: No Consequence

Present at accident: yes
 Involved in rescue: yes
     Role in rescue: Trip Leader
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
Names and ages of persons involved: 

Brian Dickey (40), Joe Vascko (47), Jamie Goodwin (25?), Weylan Dickey
(18), Tyler Dickey (14)

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): NA

Describe the events leading up to the accident: All had entered the cave
without difficulty.  Brian and Tyler were finished exploring and beginning
their exit of the cave.  Brian climbed out of the cave with some difficulty
where the rope ran between the rock forming the ceiling and entrance pit
wall and the snow cone of the cave, but was able to get around the
obstacle.  Then Tyler began his assent.

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: While ascending out of the
pit using prusik knots Tyler was unable to advance his knots over the lip
of snow.  The rope was wedged into the snow between the rock edge of a
ceiling and the icy snow cone in the cave.  Because of the position of the
knots and the rope he was unable to get the rope out of the snow.  To make
matters worse a trickle of cold snow melt was dripping directly onto him
getting him wet and making his hand very cold.  He yelled to Brian that he
was stuck and couldn’t get up.  Brian suggested that he climb back down the
rope.  

Nature of injuries sustained: NA

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: Inadequate equipment.

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.):
Unusually wet conditions in the cave.

What might have been done to prevent the accident? Not allowed the use of
prusiks on the trip.  Made sure every member of the team carried and knew
how to use a hypothermia kit.

Actions following the accident or incident:

Brian attempted to construct a redirect to get the rope away from the snow
but when he rappelled back down the rope the angle wasn’t all wrong.  At
this point he came back down to check on Tyler, who was very cold showing
signs of cold stress and perhaps mild hypothermia, with strong shivering
and emotional distress.  He was trying to warm his hands with a candle. 
Brian pulled out a plastic bag from his cave bag and place it over Tyler,
gave him some food, made him do some calisthenics, and let sit of a cave
bag to help insulate him.  His emotional state improved immediately.  At
the point the rest of the cave began arriving at the entrance pit and
became aware of the situation.  A plan was formulated to move the rope
anchor from the south end of the pit to the north end to avoid the main
obstacle.  To have Tyler use Brian’s mechanical ascenders then to get to
the surface, and then send Weylan up and back with the ascenders.  This
plan worked well.  Once the rope was in place we sent Bryce up the rope
while Brian assisted Tyler in suiting up with the ascenders and giving
instructions on how they worked.    Tyler went off on his own power.  Brian
coached while he was still in site and Tyler was soon out.  Next Weylan
went up and returned, then Joe, then Brian, and then Jamie and Weylan. 
During the process we made sure everyone else was staying as warm as
possible.  Hand warmers were passed out, hats, and extra clothing put on. 

List any persons or organizations contacted for help: NA

Describe any rescue procedures which occurred: NA


List any sources or reports with further details 
   (newspapers, grotto newsletters, etc.): NA

Additional comments or analysis: The first problem was under-estimating the
difficulty of the entrance pit and that it could be done with a prusik
climbing system.  That system should have never been allowed in this cave
even though Tyler was familiar and comfortable with his climbing system. 
It was inefficient enough to not work in this difficult situation. Second
is that the cave was wetter than expected and Tyler’s cloths were as water
resistance as he might have had otherwise.  It was a good thing that most
of the team members had emergency gear like a hypothermia kit, but it would
have been best if everyone on the trip also knew how to use them.  This
could have prevented the inconvenient situation of needing to re-rig the
pit from escalating into a dangerous situation involving hypothermia.  Both
Brian and Joe had recently attended NCRC level 1 training.  This training
helped Brian recognize and quickly treat Tyler to prevent his condition
from escalating further.  It also helped in keeping calm as the group
formulated a plan and put it into action.

  Incident Type: Caver fall
Incident Result: Injury, No Aid

Present at accident: yes
 Involved in rescue: no
     Role in rescue: As trip leader I told Donna we did not have to continue and could go back, but she insisted she was 
fine and wanted to finish stream monitoring. We did. 
Photos taken at accident: no

Description of accident/incident: 
Names and ages of persons involved: Donna Scott, 50

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): n/a

Describe the events leading up to the accident: I was leading a team of six people to do some 
stream monitoring in Berome Moore Cave. I had told my group to wear hiking boots but Donna had 
been wild caving tour before and felt she would do fine in tennis shoes. I allowed a seasoned caver 
to lead us to Main Stream. This guy makes caving look deceptively easy. At a 3 foot gap with a 
stream 6 feet below he stepped easily from our side and onto the boulder on the other. Donna 
attemped, but her foot slipped as she landed. She caught herself with her left arm and slammed her 
wrist against the rock. 

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: Donna attemped the leap, but her foot slipped as 
she landed. She caught herself with her left hand and slammed her wrist against the rock. I saw her 
on her stomach with her feet hanging down and the guy helped her up. 

Nature of injuries sustained: Her wrist hurt when she moved it. She thought she "may have sprained 
or strained it."

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: 1) poor footwear  2) allowing a fast caver to lead instead 
someone more cautious (like me-I should have been in the lead, or at least told her there was an 
optional route)

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.): Slippery rock, shoes didn't have 
enough traction.

What might have been done to prevent the accident? I should have insisted upon hiking boots and 
led her down to the stream and up the other side.

Actions following the accident or incident: We looked at her wrist. She said she was fine and wanted 
to continue to the stream to monitor and would just take it easy on her wrist. She was the note-
taker for our stream monitoring for the next 2 1/2 hours and didn't complain at all.

List any persons or organizations contacted for help: Donna went to an urgent care facility in the St. 
Louis area (90 miles from the cave) after trip was over (six hours later).

Describe any rescue procedures which occurred: n/a

List any sources or reports with further details 
   (newspapers, grotto newsletters, etc.): n/a

Additional comments or analysis: Although she broke a bone and has to wear a cast for the next six 
weeks Donna said she was glad to get hurt doing something she loved and would like to help out on 
another underground stream monitoring event.

Description of accident/incident: 
Michael Kienker (60) was leading a group of 3 novice adult cavers on a 
tour of Fulford Cave. He was in the lead when they entered the Stovepipe 
which leads into the Attic room. At the end of the Stovepipe is a U-
shaped slot which most normal-sized adults cannot fit through. On the 
other side of the slot, in the Attic, is a sloping flowstone shelf with a 
3 to 4 foot drop to the floor from the edge. The safest approach into the 
room is to maneuver 4 feet or so onto the shelf beyond the slot, with the 
use of a hand line, and then slide down the shelf to the edge and jump 
the last 3 feet to the floor. Kienker's intent was to get into the room, 
and then toss a long loop of webbing over an 8 inch stalagmite next to 
the wall at the top of the sloping shelf, and help each of the other 
cavers into the room. 
Kienker tossed his pack into the room and quickly lifted himself up and 
over the slot. Immediately, his feet went out from under him and he went 
into an uncontrolled slide down the flowstone shelf.  At the edge of the 
shelf was a broken stalagmite sticking up about 1 inch from the surface 
of the slope.  He hit the stalagmite with his tailbone and was launched 
over the edge to the floor below.  Other than pain in his tailbone, he 
was otherwise unhurt.
Kienker was able to stand up and get the hand line thrown over the 
stalagmite at the top of the slope and assist the other cavers safely 
down the shelf into the room. He was in pain but was able to get himself 
and the others out of the cave with no further incident.
X-rays were taken 2 days later and revealed a fracture of the first 
segment of the coccyx (tailbone).
After later consideration, Mike admits he should have installed the hand 
line prior to entering the room, and taken more time maneuvering over the 
slot.

Description of accident/incident: 
Gourdneck Cave, Marion Co., TN – August 1, 2017

Kyle Lassiter (26), Maureen Handler (55), and Blaine Grindle (60) were
exiting Gourdneck Cave after a 4-hour long evening survey trip. The cave is
full of short free climbs and water obstacles throughout the lower section
of cave. As Kyle Lassiter began a well-traveled free climb out of a water
canyon to a dry room bypass above a waterfall, his foothold broke. The
canyon is only two to three feet wide at this spot, and he was stepping up
on the far side of the canyon wall in order to then stem across the top of
the canyon with his other foot and arms to climb up to the dry room. He had
not yet established any firm handholds or footholds on the other side of
the canyon, so the broken foothold, located 6 feet above the bottom of the
canyon, resulted in a freefall drop of about 8-10 feet. He landed on his
back in a shallow flowing pool, luckily avoiding any solution pendants or
projections that are prevalent in this section of canyon (including the
broken foothold). He suffered a laceration and deep bruise to his right
shin, as it scraped by the broken foothold at the beginning of the fall.
Remarkably, no other significant injuries occurred. The helmet did not
impact anything during the incident, and since he was wearing his pack at
the time, it likely helped cushion some of the fall on his back. After a
few minutes to catch his breath, Kyle completed the climb and exited the
cave unassisted in about 20 minutes. Maureen administered first aid on the
surface for the shin laceration, which was beginning to bleed more freely
now that the leg was out of the cold water and into the warm Tennessee
summer night. Kyle was able to drive himself home afterwards and continue
first aid for the next several days without additional medical assistance.
It took at least a week for the bone bruising to heal enough for him to
walk normally again. He expects to make a full recovery.

Analysis: When attempting free climbs, the rule of thumb is to try and
maintain three points of contact at all times, in case a hold breaks or
slips. However, many of us, including myself, can get comfortable in
well-traveled and familiar caves and not adhere to this ideal. In
hindsight, I was basically on only one “good” point when the fall occurred,
so a fall was guaranteed when my foothold broke. I am fortunate to not have
bounced around on the nearby sharp rock blades during the fall, which would
have caused greater injuries. I have over 20 years of caving experience,
and this is by far my most significant incident and fall. On future caving
trips I will definitely be more cautious on my climbs and make a conscious
effort to try to maintain three points of contact. This is a great lesson
in guarding against complacency that I will thankfully recover and learn from.

Description of accident/incident: 
Below please find a report for the next issue of American Caving Accidents. 
In this case a caver became separated from his group and was left behind in
a gated cave. His absence was not noticed until nearly 2-1/2 days later.

At 9.63 miles, Sullivan Cave is a long cave and is one of the most heavily-
visited caves in the Midwest. It was gated in the 70s to address vandalism 
and an assortment of other issues associated with heavy visitation by 
spelunkers. In the mid-90s, the cave was purchased by the Indiana Karst 
Conservancy (while I was President of that organization). Since then there 
have been hundreds of trips to Sullivan by Scout troops. NSS grottos, etc. 
This particular trip was sponsored by the Caving Club of Indiana University 
(CCIU), and I suspect most of the participants were undergrads. Kevin 
Romanak seems to have led the trip, and "Caroline" [Bedwell] is the club 
President.

There is a second entrance to Sullivan that could have served as a means of
egress. However, it's a long, one-way trip; and expecting a novice to get 
there and self-rescue while caving solo certainly could have created its 
own issues. Note also that this incident is "still evolving" inasmuch as 
the caver drank water from a small waterfall about 40 feet from the 
entrance during his entrapment. If he suffers any adverse effects from this 
a supplement to this report will be submitted.

In reading the report, it's apparent that several standard caving protocols 
were not followed. And yet, cavers are human, and mistakes will be made. 
Such problems are best addressed by engineering than by procedure, and this 
incident provides one of the more compelling reasons that I've run into for 
not gating a cave in the first place. The IKC will consider changes in gate 
design and other options to eliminate this issue while continuing to 
provide access control. If we come up with some brilliant way to do this we 
will share our findings at the NSS convention or via an article in the 
Conservation Issue of the NSS News.

Incident Result: Aid, No Injury

Description of accident/incident: 
On Friday, October 6, 2017, five cavers went on a pull-down trip to
Solution Rift in Marion Co., TN, during the annual TAG Fall Cave-In. They
were Kyle Lassiter (26), Mark Lassiter (66), Alan Camp (47), Kitty Rose
(48), and Susan Williamson (61). Solution Rift has a difficult wet
pull-down trip route with 8 total pits and several thousand feet of
crawling to exit via a spring entrance on the valley floor. 

Securing permission from the landowner and hiking up the mountain to the
upper entrance meant the trip started around 1pm. The trip was expected to
take between 5 and 8 hours, and the group did reach the end of the cave
without incident at about 9:30pm for approximately an 8 hour trip. However,
the group could find no exit from the final room in the cave, only seeing a
nasty organic sump and a collapsed dry passage adjacent to it. No one in
the group had done the cave before, so they were unsure as to what the
problem was. The group knew they were at the very end of the cave however,
since the room they were in had an old concrete dam in it installed by the
landowner decades ago that was known to be 100 feet from the spring
entrance. Eventually the group determined that somehow the spring entrance
was collapsed or sumped for an unknown reason. The group did not check the
spring entrance before entering the cave, as dry conditions had prevailed
in Tennessee in the preceding weeks and no one thought that it would be
sumped for any reason. Trip leader Kyle had asked several people for cave
information the night before at TAG, and had not been alerted to the
possibility of the spring entrance being sumped. 

Since it was a pull-down trip, the group could not retreat back through the
cave to the upper entrance, so they were forced to wait for help to arrive.
It was decided to wait there for about another 18 hours for help, but if
none came by then to retreat back through the last 2000 foot crawl to an
area that would not flood, due to heavy rain forecast with Hurricane Nate
beginning the next night. All the cavers were wearing wetsuits for warmth,
and communally the group had one emergency blanket and a modest amount of
food and water in case of a long wait. By 10:30pm all cavers were huddled
on the mud banks of the passage out of the stream, waiting and trying to
stay warm.

When several cavers at the TAG Fall Cave-in noticed that the group had
missed their callout time, a group was assembled and put on stand-by for a
possible rescue. Around 12am, a call was made to local caver Blaine Grindle
 to check and see if the group's vehicles were still on the property. When
he confirmed that they were a short time later, upwards of a dozen cavers
were organized at TAG and initiated a rescue effort. Kelly Smallwood
organized two teams of cavers, one for each entrance. The upper entrance
team, led by Jason Hardy, was to hard rig the cave from the top, while the
spring entrance team was primarily going to check that the entrance was
open, and to proceed into the cave as far as the bottom of the last pit if
necessary. Local EMS was notified and arrived on the property, and the
local Chattanooga-Hamilton County Rescue Squad (CHCRS) was notified and
placed on standby as well. 

As soon as Kelly and the spring entrance team arrived at the spring
entrance, it was immediately obvious that two massive beaver dams had
swamped the whole side of the valley and sumped the spring entrance to the
cave under several feet of water. Kelly immediately called the upper
entrance team to come down and help destroy the beaver dams, which were the
obvious reason why the caving group would still be in the cave. After at
least an hour of digging the dams were breached. Around 4am, the cave group
noticed water levels receding inside the cave. Voice contact through the
spring entrance was made a few minutes later, and the group confirmed to
the rescuers that there were no injuries or other problems except mild
hypothermia from waiting for the last 6 hours. The cave continued to drain
rapidly, and by 4:30am all cavers were able to exit the cave. EMS and CHCRS
were called off, and everyone involved was back to TAG by 7am.

An article will be written by trip leader Kyle Lassiter with additional
details of this event, to be published in the 2017 winter edition of the
Sewanee Mountain Grotto's newsletter, the TAG Caver.

Analysis:
Dam beavers (pun intended)! First, many thanks to all the cavers who
stopped partying at TAG to come to our rescue! We were fortunate to have so
many good cavers concentrated in one place at the same time who were able
to come to our aid. This certainly minimized the amount of waiting our team
had to endure before we were rescued. Special thanks to Kelly Smallwood and
Jason Hardy who were expeditious in the planning of the rescue efforts,
which also contributed to our relatively short wait. 

Obviously, our team was unaware that beavers had sumped the exit to the
cave with their dams. We did not think we needed to check the spring
entrance for being sumped due to very dry conditions in the prior weeks,
and indeed the cave was not sumped due to high regional water levels. In my
conversations with numerous other cavers who had been through Solution Rift
the night before, concerns about beaver dams sumping the cave exit were not
mentioned to me. After this incident, we have since learned that beavers
frequently dam up this part of the valley, and the prior landowner used to
be key in removing them often. Thus, we did not go out of our way to check
the spring entrance for beaver dams before hiking up to the upper entrance.
I do not personally know of any other caves in the TAG region that have
this unique problem, so it did not occur to anyone on the trip that this
was even remotely possible. Lesson here is obviously to check that the
lower entrance to a pull-down trip is open before attempting it! A note has
now been added to the TCS narrative for this cave to check for beaver dams
at the spring entrance. No note was in it before the trip; if one had been
I would have read it and this incident could have been avoided.

Finally, while we survived our wait in the cave with minimal hardship, we
all wished that we had brought more emergency blankets and food with us to
make the wait for tolerable. Also, once we were trapped, we realized that
different members of the team had given our different friends at TAG
different callout times, so we were unsure when we could hope for rescue
crews to arrive. Thankfully, they came sooner than later! Lesson here is to
confirm with your team members what the callout time is going to be for the
trip, should you unfortunately have to rely on it.

Description of accident/incident: 
Names and ages of persons involved: Lori Harris, 54 years of age.

Names of rescue teams involved (if any): Michael Harris (Husband) and Michael Gibbons

Describe the events leading up to the accident: Lori Harris was part of a Bexar Grott team 
leading a group of scouts in Robber Baron Cave. Approximately 45 minutes into the trip the 
team entered into the Great Southwest Passage. This passage is a tall and narrow crevice 
style passage requiring  personas to stem across the wall for approximately 60 feet. The walls 
are scalloped limestone and on this day they were slightly damp. Lori had traversered 
approximately 5 feet out when the group stopped. Michael Gibbons was awaiting to enter the 
passage

Describe how the accident or incident occurred: 
Lori stopped when the group stopped and after about 5 minutes one of her feet slipped slightly 
causing her to loose her footing which caused her to fall straight down approximately 10 feet. 
Lori pressed against the cave wall with both hands and feet in an attempt to slow down her 
decent. Lori hit the bottom with both legs straight and landed mostly on her left leg. After 
landing, Lori's knees buckled and she fell to her knees and felt a slight pain below her left 
knee. Michael Harris was leading the group. As the scouts were nearing the end of the 
passage Michael Harris asked how they were doing when one of the scouts advised "we're 
good, but I think the lady in the back fell." Michael Harris quickly went through his mental 
attendance roster and then exclaimed "oh crap, it's my wife."  The trip leader's role was then 
handed over to another Grotto member. While Michael Harris was making his way back to 
Lori, Michael Gibbons was already in the process of accessing the severity of the injury. Once 
it was determined that Lori could not put weight on her left leg, both she and the two Michaels 
devised a strategy to self-rescue. Michael Harris assisted Lori in climbing to the upper part of 
the passage by helping with foot placement and hand holds. Once that was accomplished and 
all three cavers were out of the deeper part of the crevice, there was still another 6-8 foot 
section (approximately 6 feet deep) that needed to be traversed. In order to traverse this 
section, Michael Harris climbed down and Lori climbed on his shoulders. Michael Harris then 
walked across where Michael Gibbons helped Lori off of Michael Harris's shoulders and onto 
level ground in the passage. Lori hopped on her right leg down the Male Passage for 
approximately 75 feet until they reached The Main Stem passage. Lori continued to hop on 
her right leg through this passage for about 50 feet until they reached The Lighted Passage. It 
was in this passage that Lori climbed on her husband's back for a 70-foot piggy back ride until 
they crossed over to the Entrance Hall. Due to the low ceiling of this passage, Lori laid on 
Michal Harris's back while he crawled through 90 feet of the 145 foot long passage. Michael 
Gibbons went to the surface and retrieved his hiking poles, Gatorade, and soaked a towel. 
The hiking poles were secured by Lori's knee pad straps to stabilize the leg. After a few sips of 
Gatorade and cooling off with the towel Lori was able to scoot backwards the remaining 55 
feet of the passage to the cave gate. Once Lori crawled through the gate she was assisted by 
Michael Gibbons and Greg Mosier. Both helped Lori up the 110 foot path leading from the 
sink-hole.

Nature of injuries sustained: Fractured tibia plateau to the left knee. 

Analysis of the main cause of the accident: Loss of footing on walls of cave passage during 
stemming.

List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.): Walls of the cave were slightly 
damp.

What might have been done to prevent the accident? N/A

Actions following the accident or incident: Self rescue was performed and the caver was able 
to exit with assistance by fellow cavers on the trip. Approximately two months earlier, a 
practice cave rescue was performed from the same area of the cave as the accident and it 
required more than two hours to extract the patient using a sked and stretcher.

Describe the events leading up to the accident:
Bill Clinton Pot, a 66' pit in Van Buren County, was the last thing we 
visited about mid afternoon on Sunday, Sept. 17th.
Describe how the accident or incident occurred: 
Shawn climbed out first. I followed as Marion waited on bottom.The pit 
is clean(no loose rocks)so I guess my guard was down. On a ledge about 
forty feet off the floor is a row of stubby stalagmites, each about six 
inches in height and diameter. I was using a ropewalker. My left foot 
brushed one of the stalagmites, which appeared to be attached, but 
turned out to be sitting on nothing but loose dirt on the ledge. As 
soon as I realized what happened I yelled "ROCK", and turned my head to 
witness the stalagmite making a bee-line straight for Marion's head. 
The whole thing transpired in about a second so there was no time for 
Marion to react(the pit was about fifteen feet in diameter at the 
bottom and Marion was along the far wall.
Nature of injuries sustained: 
Marion was hit in the head(helmet on). When I went back down to him, he 
was bleeding from his left ear, in great pain, and too dizzy to stand. 
It was later determined that he had sustained a lower left temporal 
fracture of the skull.
Analysis of the main cause of the accident:
I would have to say carelessness on my(McClanathan) part. Shawn climbed 
up without touching the stalagmite.The pit was basically clean. Between 
Marion and I we've logged over 5,000 pits or pit caves, many of which 
have been horror holes, but this one was a nice pit. I guess I just let 
my guard down. It was a freak accident. Why didn't the stalagmite just 
fall straight down instead of careening across the pit(Marion was 
against the opposite wall)? Why, with over 200 square feet of space on 
the bottom of the pit, did it hit in the one square foot occupied by 
Marion's head?
List any contributing factors (weather, equipment, fatigue, etc.):
No contributing factors
What might have been done to prevent the accident?
Hindsight is always 20/20.I should have watched where I put my foot, 
but I was just climbing in a clean pit. Stalagmites are assumed to be 
attached, but these were not. The only thing I can say is that, when it 
appears that nothing can go wrong, that might be when you need to be at 
your most vigilant.
Actions following the accident or incident:
We(Marion and I) relayed instructions to Shawn, who stayed topside, to 
get to Marion's truck and call a couple of area cavers. Considering 
that Shawn was not familiar with the geographical area, he did a great 
job of contacting cavers and directing them to the right location. I 
stayed with Marion and made a couple of trips up the pit to retrieve 
whatever extra clothing we had between us to keep him as warm as 
possible. He never lost consciousness and was able to move his neck and 
head around, though the dizziness never abated and he became nauseous a 
couple of times.
After about two hours, Marion was becoming chilled and thought he might 
be better off trying to climb out. He thought if he could get an 
ascender on the rope he could use it to pull himself up, but he 
expressed concern that he could pass out. We had plenty of excess rope 
on the bottom of the pit, so I suggested that I go back up and re-rig 
the rope so that I could lower Marion back to the floor if he should 
lose consciousness. Marion attached an ascender to the end of the rope 
and I climbed back out, then pulled up all the extra rope which I wound 
around a couple of trees so I could belay him safely back to the floor 
if need be. It took him a while to get upright and start to climb, but 
once initiated he climbed without incident, reaching the surface in 
about fifteen minutes. He became exhausted negotiating the lip at the 
top, but by then I could hear the approach of others. 
List any persons or organizations contacted for help:
Local cavers Jim Fox and Zeke McKee, Shawn Hogbin and 
I(McClanathan)were also present, Van Buren County Rescue squad, several 
Fall Creek Falls park personnel  
Describe any rescue procedures which occurred:
Marion was able to ascend the pit on his own power, which was a great 
aide to the rescue. Getting over the lip exhausted him, and he was 
unable to walk off the mountain. Van Buren County Rescue tended to him 
on site and carried him off in a litter. He was then taken to Sparta 
Hospital and from there flown to Chattanooga.
List any sources or reports with further details 
   (newspapers, grotto newsletters, etc.):

Additional comments or analysis: What can I say. Marion and I can claim 
over a century of experience between us in thousands of casves, some of 
which are among the most challenging caves in the country. Was it just 
our time? Treat the simplest cave with the same respect that you would 
a difficult one, and be just as careful on your multi-thousandth cave 
as you were on your first. Never assume that nothing unforeseen can 
happen just because a cave or pit is easy.
