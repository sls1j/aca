					<h1>Elders of the Tribe</h1>					<i>						<div>Bill Putnam, ACA Editor</div>						<div>December, 1997</div>					</i>
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">					Welcome to the long-awaited 1994-1995 issue of American Caving
					Accidents. In this issue you will find 148 accident and safety incident
					reports. During the review process, some members of the review committee asked
					me why certain minor incidents were included for publication. The incidents in
					question were those which resulted in minor injury or inconvenience, but had no
					serious consequence. I would like to take a few moments to discuss the purpose
					of this publication, as I see it. As I do, I believe my reasons for including
					these minor incidents will become clear.				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">					American Caving Accidents is not just an exercise in record keeping. It
					serves several purposes for the Society. Yes, it is the primary record of
					caving accidents in North America. That is a
					valuable service which the Society provides. But my discussions with cavers
					over 17 years of caving, and over the last year as I prepared this publication,
					have convinced me that this record keeping role is not the most important function
					of the publication.				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">					Many cavers have said to me that ACA is the most useful publication
					they receive from the NSS. They feel this way because they recognize the
					benefits to their own caving abilities and activities to be gained from reading
					about the accidents, incidents, near-misses, and close calls described in these
					pages. They realize that this publication presents them with the opportunity to
					learn from the mistakes or misfortunes of their fellow cavers.				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">					When I began caving in 1980, I was fortunate to have several good					friends who acted as mentors, teaching me safe caving techniques, instructing					me in the importance of cave conservation, and introducing me into the					community of cavers. These cavers told me dozens of stories around the campfire,					or over dinner, or on the long drives to and from the caves. In the process,					they passed on to me the collective experience of many, many cavers, gained					over decades of active caving. What they were doing, whether they realized it					or not, was fulfilling their roles as “elders of the tribe”.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					You know what I mean. We may not want to admit it, but we all get					older. Some of us get a little wiser in the process. Eventually, we realize					that those new cavers look pretty young. Years ago, when there weren't so many					of us (and of them) we knew them all and we took them into our ranks and under					our wings, teaching them how to cave without hurting themselves, their friends,					or the caves.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					Today, the caving community is so large that we can not know everyone.					My own grotto is so large that there are quite a few folks I may never cave					with or get to know. Years ago I helped teach vertical training sessions. In					the course of a day on the cliffs or on a training trip I would regale my					captive audience with tales of close calls, nasty injuries, near misses,					rescues, and fatal accidents. I wanted them to understand the consequences of					rockfall in a pit, rigging the rack backwards, losing control of a rappel, or					wearing a cheap hard-hat. I believed then (and I still do) that you have to					have some way to take the abstract rules of safety and technique and					personalize them, in order to really understand and appreciate them. You have					to know the story behind or beyond the rules.				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">					American Caving Accidents is part of what my friend Dave Hughes likes					to call “the pool of archival knowledge”. It is a collection of shared					experiences that can help the reader connect the abstract rules and techniques					found in books or imparted by teachers with the real world of caving that we					all experience. When we read about the caver who dropped his only light down					the pit and became stranded, or the one whose climbing helmet saved his life,					we remember the stories. The phrases “three sources of light” and “cheap					hard-hats are for cheap heads” have more meaning.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					Almost 18 years later, I clearly remember many of the stories I was					told by my mentors. Most were hair-raising tales of near-misses. Nobody got					hurt, and they all laughed about it later, but they knew (and I learned) just					how close they were to death or serious injury. These near-miss stories were					every bit as important in my training as the stories of serious accidents. They					taught me that inattention, miscommunication, and mistakes can happen to anyone					– no matter how experienced. And they taught me that there is only a split					second and one bad decision separating an enjoyable caving trip from tragedy.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					American Caving Accidents is a teaching tool. It's a communication					channel. It is a way for us to pass on to the new cavers the collective experience					and wisdom of the tribe. We can't take all the new cavers out caving, or share					stories around the fire with them. But we can publish our experiences for them					to read. In the process, perhaps we will remind ourselves of important lessons					that we have forgotten.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					Eventually, I acquired responsibilities which limited my caving time. I					became reluctant to devote precious caving weekends to teaching the new cavers.					I wanted to spend the time that I had on fun things, like mapping and					exploration, project caving, and so on. I wanted to spend that time with my old					buddies, not with strangers. So I stopped leading the beginner trips and					teaching the training sessions.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					But I still like to tell the stories, on trips and around the campfire.					I present programs to my grotto on safety and techniques. I have become					involved in cave rescue work. When the opportunity arises, I try to be a good					mentor to some of the new cavers that I meet.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					I realize that I owe a great debt to my mentors. Steve Attaway, Ed					Strausser, Buddy Lane, and many others taught me things that have kept me 					alive and caving. But the debt I owe is payable, not to them, but to the 					new generations of cavers. We all owe that debt.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					Reading ACA is a great way for all cavers, not just new ones, to build					knowledge and awareness of safe caving practices. But it is still up to each					one of us to teach and promote safety at every meeting and on every trip.				</div>				<div class="paragraph">					How will you meet your responsibility as one of the elders of the					caving tribe?				</div>			</div>		</article>				<!--#include virtual="/includes/footer.html"-->
